# PalindromeCheck
Simple program that returns true or false if a given word is palindrome or not.

This program uses my own implementation of an abstract stack. Although a stack type char is sufficient 
for this palindrome application, the implementation of the Stack object in this program can be used
with any other data type (ints, string, or more complex user-defined objects).

TODO:
- Add command line functionality
- Create makefile
